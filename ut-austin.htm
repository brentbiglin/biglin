       <h1>UT Austin</h1>
          <span>9 November 2016</span>
          <p>I’m starting a graduate program at UT Austin in January! I’ll be studying User Experience and Information Architecture for a Master’s of Science in Information Science at the School of Information.</p>
          <p>I’m bummed to be leaving my colleagues at the San Antonio Education Partnership and I hope to be able to continue to contribute by volunteering and helping out with projects—especially ones in which I can use my new and developing skills and expertise.</p>
          <p>I initially considered renting out a room or trying to sublet an apartment near campus, but after considering the price and the fact that I have a home in San Antonio already, I’ve decided that I’m going to try to take the Megabus on the three days per week that I have class. It’s five dollars and two hours each way, but at least I can read on the bus and don’t have to worry about driving in Austin traffic—it’s the worst. I’m sure I’ll have some rough commute days, but I already spend a great deal of time sitting around on a computer, right? I might as well be getting somewhere while I do it. I know a couple of couches (and the people who own them) that I can crash on if need be.</p>
          <p>If you’re at the iSchool or know someone who is, send me an email or tweet at me! This will be a new program and a change of course for me intellectually and profesionally and I’m eager to hear others’ perspectives and experiences.</p>
