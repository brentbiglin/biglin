       <h1>Conversational UI</h1>
          <span>2 November 2016</span>
          <p>Voice user interfaces like Google Assistant, Siri, and Cortana have been such a fixture of in our imagining what the future of tech will be. Being able to speak to an artificially intelligent assistant at some point in the future is taken for granted; it’s just a matter of time. But one of the downsides of a voice interface is that the affordances are hidden--possibilities are not obvious to the user. You just have to try asking a question or issuing a command and see if you’re understood.</p>
          <p>You have to get to know the assistant as you do another person to know what it’s capable of and what it knows. In that way, the assistant has to become conversational not just as a response to queries or commands, but as a participant in a conversation that asks follow-up questions and even initiates conversation. We can’t know what an assistant can do unless it tells us, and it won’t know what we need unless it gets to know us. I think that individualizing each assistant for each person is a great idea because each of us have different needs and desires regarding what our assistant should help us with, but what if designers were to go another step towards emulating us linguistically and attitudinally? Maybe I want my assistant to occasionally be sarcastic with a slightly dry and dark sense of humor, because that’s how I am.</p>
          <p>How much more effective would assistants be if we could suspend our disbelief that they actually understand and relate to us in a certain way? What if Siri or Cortana occasionally asked you how you were doing or what your favorite movie is? Mirroring a user could be a great way to build a relationship with an assistant in a way that makes it more personal and therefore more powerful and useful. People would use it more and provide more input to make it better.</p>
          <p>For those who are concerned with privacy, this might be a little creepy. You cannot build an authentic personal relationship with a device or a digital assistant and it would be pretty easy to take this idea way too far. Some people feel badgered by their software updates already, which could be even worse if they feel like their phones are nagging them for some emotional attention. But if a designer’s goal is to help a user out throughout their daily life while also delighting them, what better way than to give a virtual assistant a little personal touch? My personal assistant should speak to me in my dialect, mirror my attitude, and occasionally ask me questions—until that happens, the conversation is going to be one-sided.</p>

        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
          <p>I graduated from the Ohio State University in 2009 with my Bachelor’s degree, having majored in Comparative Cultural Studies and Arabic Language and Literature with a minor in International Studies. Two years later, I returned to OSU to complete my Master’s degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, during which time I taught Elementary and Intermediate Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
          <p>Upon graduation, I moved to San Antonio and began teaching English as a Foreign Language on the University of the Incarnate Word campus, and later taught Arabic at San Antonio College. I'm currently conducting an independent study in Intermediate Arabic Morphology and Syntax with a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Since last May, I've been a College Access and Success Advisor for the San Antonio Education Partnership at cafécollege, utilizing my experiences in academia as a first-generation college student to advise students on their educational and professional paths.</p>
          <p>Having seen the difficulty that many students face, I became very interested in UX, information architecture, and design in general—particularly as it relates to language and education for the underprivileged and underrepresented.</p>
