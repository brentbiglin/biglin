       <h1>Website Update</h1>

          <span>17 September 2016</span>

          <p>I’ve been learning a ton by remaking my site from scratch using GitHub. I had made a pretty basic website using Wix and so I used that as a prototype to learn the HTML and CSS required for the modest site you see before you. There was JavaScript involved, but that is beyond my knowledge and skill. I incorporated a <a href="http://codepen.io/koenigsegg1/pen/dYzmpj">Pen</a> by a guy named <a href="http://codepen.io/koenigsegg1/">Kyle Lavery</a> from <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen.io</a>. I also had a lot of help from my friend <a href="http://jalan.io">Jason</a> with some quirky nuisances in my HTML and CSS. This also explains my lack of an update for the past couple of weeks. A substantive one has been in the works and will be posted soon!</p>

          <p>I have a vague memory of making a little website in middle school. I was pretty jazzed with divs, which I had just discovered and barely understood. But I used them! I made a site with hardly any content and it was just a giant frame with borders and links to the side. I was pretty proud of it, but unfortunately had nothing really to say or show and no need for a website in the first place. It’s comforting to know that the basics of HTML and the underlying infrastructure of websites are more or less the same as they were over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>My current site is now about 10 times leaner than it was before and loads much more quickly. I also have the benefit of understanding exactly what has gone into it, with the exception of the fancy Floating Action Buttons on the bottom right. I understand their placement and I customized their design a bit, but the JavaScript required to make it bob up and down and spin around--not so much. I suppose I’ll need to learn some JavaScript eventually. To me, there’s a big difference between a markup or stylesheet language and a programming language. The first two just declare where things are and what qualities they should have, while programming languages make things <em>do</em> stuff. However, I’ve never been one to shrink from the challenge of learning a new language, no matter how different it might be from what I already know, so I look forward to learning more.</p>

        <h1><a id="about">About Me</a></h1>
          <p>I graduated from the Ohio State University in 2009 with my Bachelor’s degree, having majored in Comparative Cultural Studies and Arabic Language and Literature with a minor in International Studies. Two years later, I returned to OSU to complete my Master’s degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, during which time I taught Elementary and Intermediate Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
          <p>Upon graduation, I moved to San Antonio and began teaching English as a Foreign Language on the University of the Incarnate Word campus, and later taught Arabic at San Antonio College. I'm currently conducting an independent study in Intermediate Arabic Morphology and Syntax with a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Since last May, I've been a College Access and Success Advisor for the San Antonio Education Partnership at cafécollege, utilizing my experiences in academia as a first-generation college student to advise students on their educational and professional paths.</p>
          <p>Having seen the difficulty that many students face, I became very interested in UX, information architecture, and design in general--particularly as it relates to language and education for the underprivileged and underrepresented.</p>
