        <h1>UT Austin</h1>
        <span>9 November 2016</span>
        <p>I’m starting a graduate program at UT Austin in January! I’ll be studying User Experience and Information Architecture for a Master’s of Science in Information Science at the School of Information.</p>
        <p>I’m bummed to be leaving my colleagues at the San Antonio Education Partnership and I hope to be able to continue to contribute by volunteering and helping out with projects—especially ones in which I can use my new and developing skills and expertise.</p>
        <p>I initially considered renting out a room or trying to sublet an apartment near campus, but after considering the price and the fact that I have a home in San Antonio already, I’ve decided that I’m going to try to take the Megabus on the three days per week that I have class. It’s five dollars and two hours each way, but at least I can read on the bus and don’t have to worry about driving in Austin traffic—it’s the worst. I’m sure I’ll have some rough commute days, but I already spend a great deal of time sitting around on a computer, right? I might as well be getting somewhere while I do it. I know a couple of couches (and the people who own them) that I can crash on if need be.</p>
        <p>If you’re at the iSchool or know someone who is, send me an email or tweet at me! This will be a new program and a change of course for me intellectually and profesionally and I’m eager to hear others’ perspectives and experiences.</p>

        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
          <p>I graduated from the Ohio State University in 2009 with my Bachelor’s degree, having majored in Comparative Cultural Studies and Arabic Language and Literature with a minor in International Studies. Two years later, I returned to OSU to complete my Master’s degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, during which time I taught Elementary and Intermediate Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
          <p>Upon graduation, I moved to San Antonio and began teaching English as a Foreign Language on the University of the Incarnate Word campus, and later taught Arabic at San Antonio College. I'm currently conducting an independent study in Intermediate Arabic Morphology and Syntax with a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Since last May, I've been a College Access and Success Advisor for the San Antonio Education Partnership at cafécollege, utilizing my experiences in academia as a first-generation college student to advise students on their educational and professional paths.</p>
          <p>Having seen the difficulty that many students face, I became very interested in UX, information architecture, and design in general—particularly as it relates to language and education for the underprivileged and underrepresented.</p>
