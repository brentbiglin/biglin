       <h1>Centered Sets</h1>

          <span>20 September 2016</span>

          <p>I was reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intertwingled-Information-Everything-Peter-Morville/dp/0692225587/">Intertwingled</a> by <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/">Peter Morville</a> last month and he introduced me to a concept that I’d never heard of before: centered sets. It’s actually an idea that originated in theology in opposition to bounded sets.</p>

          <p>Centered sets demonstrate the powerful impact that categorization and labeling can have on our perception of the world—even to the extent that it can flip a binary “is” to an “isn’t.” A centered set is actually more of a system in which people (in this case) revolve around a central ideal. In the original conception brought forth by the missionary Paul Hiebert, the question was whether or not someone could be considered Christian. Within a bounded set, a person would have to fulfill a set of criteria in order to qualify as Christian. In a centered set, a person would be considered a Christian if they were heading towards the ideal of a Christian through study and practice. Those moving away from the ideal Christian would not fit in the set. For Hiebert, this helped to determine whether or not a person was Christian after hearing the Christian gospel one time and accepting it in contrast to someone who had been a Christian their whole life while not practicing the faith. In a centered set, the newly Christian is moving towards the ideal Christian and therefore is considered a Christian. The long-time Christian would be drifting further from the ideal and therefore would not fit within the set.  In a bounded set, one could easily argue the contrary.</p>

          <p>I find this concept interesting because of the way it can radically alter what qualifies to be in a set. It could be useful to think of more aspirational labels as centered sets to emphasize that it is a goal to work for, and that one is qualified to be within the set as long as progress is being made. This mindset would encourage self-improvement, learning, and a kind of self-acceptance to combat impostor syndrome or feelings of not belonging. It contributes to a discourse of encouragement in the Foucauldian sense: as ways of constructing knowledge, and therefore the power systems therein. If we don’t create systems of knowledge that encourage us to be better, then we will be influenced by those that have been constructed for us. It’s useful to question whether or not you hold a certain belief or opinion because you truly believe it as an individual, or if you were just there when that belief or idea happened to you and so you decided it was yours.</p>

          <p>To make systems of knowledge understandable, we have to understand the words and their histories. Why don’t “master” and “mistress” mean the same thing? If you’re creating a form or asking someone a question, what kind of assumptions are being made if you use the words “husband” or “wife” instead of “spouse” or “partner”? If you understand the archaeology of words, then you start to perceive the whole constellation of intention and meaning in which they were constructed, and the world starts to reveal its true design. The words used reveal who the world was designed by and for.</p>

          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Archaeology-Knowledge-Discourse-Language-Foucault/dp/B007YZODXY" style="font-weight: normal;">
            <blockquote>
              <p>The world does not provide us with a legible face, leaving us merely to decipher it; it does not work hand in glove with what we already know … We must conceive discourse as a violence that we do to things, or, at all events, as a practice we impose upon them; it is in this practice that the events of discourse find the principle of their regularity.</p>
              <span>Michel Foucault, The Discourse on Language</span>
            </blockquote>
          </a>

          <p>Centered sets are a way of making these labels and discourses more intentional and deliberate. Am I a web developer? This is the only site I’ve ever made, and I’ve never been paid for my rudimentary skills (on the contrary, I’ve paid to have this website hosted and so I’ve lost money). But I’m making progress, and within a centered set, that’s enough encouragement for me to learn more. In the same way, design in general should be inclusive, open, and therefore encouraging to all people. The way things are designed should implicitly and explicitly tell people, “You belong here and this is for you.”</p>

        <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
          <p>I graduated from the Ohio State University in 2009 with my Bachelor’s degree, having majored in Comparative Cultural Studies and Arabic Language and Literature with a minor in International Studies. Two years later, I returned to OSU to complete my Master’s degree in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, during which time I taught Elementary and Intermediate Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
          <p>Upon graduation, I moved to San Antonio and began teaching English as a Foreign Language on the University of the Incarnate Word campus, and later taught Arabic at San Antonio College. I'm currently conducting an independent study in Intermediate Arabic Morphology and Syntax with a student at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Since last May, I've been a College Access and Success Advisor for the San Antonio Education Partnership at cafécollege, utilizing my experiences in academia as a first-generation college student to advise students on their educational and professional paths.</p>
          <p>Having seen the difficulty that many students face, I became very interested in UX, information architecture, and design in general—particularly as it relates to language and education for the underprivileged and underrepresented.</p>
