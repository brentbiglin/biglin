        <h1>Website Update</h1>

          <span>17 September 2016</span>

          <p>I’ve been learning a ton by remaking my site from scratch using GitHub. I had made a pretty basic website using Wix and so I used that as a prototype to learn the HTML and CSS required for the modest site you see before you. There was JavaScript involved, but that is beyond my knowledge and skill. I incorporated a <a href="http://codepen.io/koenigsegg1/pen/dYzmpj">Pen</a> by a guy named <a href="http://codepen.io/koenigsegg1/">Kyle Lavery</a> from <a href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen.io</a>. I also had a lot of help from my friend <a href="http://jalan.io">Jason</a> with some quirky nuisances in my HTML and CSS. This also explains my lack of an update for the past couple of weeks. A substantive one has been in the works and will be posted soon!</p>

          <p>I have a vague memory of making a little website in middle school. I was pretty jazzed with divs, which I had just discovered and barely understood. But I used them! I made a site with hardly any content and it was just a giant frame with borders and links to the side. I was pretty proud of it, but unfortunately had nothing really to say or show and no need for a website in the first place. It’s comforting to know that the basics of HTML and the underlying infrastructure of websites are more or less the same as they were over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>My current site is now about 10 times leaner than it was before and loads much more quickly. I also have the benefit of understanding exactly what has gone into it, with the exception of the fancy Floating Action Buttons on the bottom right. I understand their placement and I customized their design a bit, but the JavaScript required to make it bob up and down and spin around--not so much. I suppose I’ll need to learn some JavaScript eventually. To me, there’s a big difference between a markup or stylesheet language and a programming language. The first two just declare where things are and what qualities they should have, while programming languages make things <em>do</em> stuff. However, I’ve never been one to shrink from the challenge of learning a new language, no matter how different it might be from what I already know, so I look forward to learning more.</p>
