        <h1>Tech Literacy and Norms</h1>

          <span>26 August 2016</span>

          <p>It’s taken for granted that the generations before us will struggle with technology and the generations after us will be fluent in it, having been born with it and surrounded by it since. We assume that younger people will be able to use it intuitively and be native to its norms. I think a couple of reasons we make this false assumption is that good design can make some technology seem very natural and that some technology that younger people use seems counterintuitive and difficult to use to older folks. As an example, I don’t find Snapchat very compelling even though I’m on the older edge of “Millenial.” I’m able to use it and I understand how it works, but the way that it’s operated doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. The first few times I used it, I tried to send (or publish?) a photo that I’d already taken with my phone, which at that time was not possible to do. It took me a bit of experimentation to find out where my “feed” was, which is actually more of a list of contacts with updated snaps. It’s not that I wasn’t able to figure it out, but that I had to explore the app; more importantly, exploring the app wasn’t very fun. I don’t mind a little adventure as long as it’s a neat experience.</p>

          <p>It would be easy to assume that apps like Snapchat will proliferate and leave me increasingly bewildered until technology has slowly passed me by. Soon, younger people will be explaining to me how to operate an app just as I’ve patiently taught my parents how to video chat. However, I don’t think this is the case. I think that Snapchat is popular despite its bad design because it fulfilled the desire people had to send short videos to one another. There’s no reason this can’t be incorporated into a messenger app well enough that Snapchat will not outlive its own novelty, or that another app that’s simpler and easier to use will dethrone it. My mother doesn’t care about technology whatsoever, and failed to see my updates from Costa Rica because she couldn’t be bothered to download Hangouts on her new phone. Her alliance with technology is very tenuous. But when I suggested that she download Duo, I received a video chat request from her half an hour later. In short, it’s very easy to use.</p>
          <p>Our ability to use technology is balanced by good design and our having been taught how to use it. Someone might find something difficult to use initially but, having been taught how, can then leverage it as a powerful and effective tool. Adobe Photoshop is powerful, but no one would call it intuitive. Other apps are intuitive and easy to use right away, but by their very nature will be limited in what can be accomplished with them. Duo has literally one purpose, and doesn’t even support group chats. Why would we assume that young people will be able to use Photoshop as easily as they can use Duo?</p>

          <p>As an advisor, I see students struggle with typing. Instead of using Shift to capitalize a single letter, they’ll use Caps Lock because that’s how you capitalize text on a mobile keyboard. When they fill out forms, they’ll receive an error message because they’ve inserted a space after every entry; that’s how you make sure a mobile keyboard autocorrects a word in case you spelled it wrong. For many people, mobile is their first and primary access to the internet. Their computer literacy classes in high school are not comprehensive, or they’re non-existent. This demonstrates not only the importance of designing for mobile, but better education. What all people, not just young people, are learning on mobile does not translate to technology in general or to desktop computing in particular. Computer literacy needs to be taught and it needs to be a subject that is just as important as reading, writing, and arithmetic. We can’t assume that younger people are going to be as good as or better at technology than us. They’re not, unless we teach them.</p>
          <p>Another thing I want to mention but not go into in-depth is an absence of technology norms being taught to young people. Gender-, race-, and sexuality-based internet harrassment is a huge problem. Much of it is perpetrated by straight-up sexists and racists, but I suspect that many harrassers are young people who are imitating bad behavior and will eventually internalize the toxicity if they are not taught otherwise. We cannot wait for norms to naturally arise and assert themselves; social progress is not inevitable and must be cultivated through mindful effort. We can’t pretend that harrassment is some sort of natural phenomenon and focus on what to do when it inevitably happens; the first thing to do to stop it is for people to stop doing it. Think about what you communicate online. Think about how it might make someone feel. You are talking to other people, not characters in a game. Call out toxic behavior you see in relatives and friends. Don’t assume your nephew, niece, son, or daughter are the same person online that they are in person. Talk to them about behavior online and make sure they know that their information is not private and can have repercussions in real life. In addition, there need to be better tools for reporting and minimizing harrassment. People learn first by imitation, and they imitate and learn based on what they see and experience themselves. This is why education and a pleasant and productive user experience is so important.</p>
