        <p>At the User Experience Professionals Association conference this year, I was a part of the University of Texas team at the Student Design Competition with two colleagues. We were given less than three days to research, design, and present "a smart assistant that can build, and act on, a shopping list of products and services from multiple retailers." We were judged on a seven-minute pitch and a fifteen-minute final presentation.</p>
        <p>We explored the problem space, thought of many solutions, and then focused on a single concept that we then iterated upon.</p>
        <figure><img src="img/cachecart-userjourney.jpg" class="small" alt="CacheCart user journey graphic"></figure>
        <p>After mapping out the user journey, we distributed an online survey and received 174 responses within a matter of hours. In addition, we conducted several qualitative in-person interviews. Our potential user-base was most concerned with saving money and reducing waste.</p>

        <figure><img src="img/cachecart-foodexpires.svg" class="noshadow" alt="Graph of how often peoples' food expires at home"></figure>
        <p>Therefore, we focused on expiration date notification and an intelligent and user-centered checklist. The application is also very accessible in that any action could be taken either by touching and typing or by voice.  I went straight to a low-fidelity mockup due to the the very limited amount of time available and the straightforward function of the application: a household management application that lists items to be bought as well as an inventory of purchased pantry items. For perishable items, the expiration date is either estimated by the assistant or recorded by the user. The application would then inform the user of impending expiration dates. Based on user testing using an interactive mock-up and judges' feedback, I iterated upon this design.</p>
        <figure><img src="img/cachecart-designdev.png" class="noshadow" alt="CacheCart design development"></figure>
        <p>The list is organized from the bottom to the top so that the next list item is easy to reach. It's also larger at the bottom so that it can be glanced. Because many people go to the same grocery store and purchase items along the same route through the store, our application would remember the order in which items were checked off the list and then present them in that order on the next shopping trip.</p>
        <p>The application could be monetized by soliciting promotions from grocery stores and then offering customers the option of receiving notifications of sales and discounts. Our research found that the largest concern for potential users was low cost. As a result, this sort of promotional advertising would be welcomed by users as long as it is optional and above all useful to them.</p>

        <p>I took the design competition as an opportunity to try Adobe XD, which is currently in beta, rather than my usual tools of Sketch and InVision for designing and creating interactive mock-ups.</p>

        <p>Try interacting with the mock-up below! If you click anywhere, it will highlight clickable areas, which will take you to the corresponding artboard. We used this mock-up for in-person user testing and to test user flows as well.</p>
