          <p>As a part of a course at the University of Texas, I have the opportunity to take part in the creation of a website for the Russian School of Austin, which is a local extracurricular program that offers various subjects in Russian on Sundays. After a competitive analysis of websites for similar programs, we met with the client and were able to probe into what exactly they want the website to provide to the students and parents of the school.
          <p>We then visited the school on a Sunday during classes in order to experience the atmosphere and to conduct a contextual inquiry of the school, its teachers, administrators, parents, and students. By observing the school as classes were in session, we were able to gain insight into the dynamics of the community and the unique challenges that its members face. We were then able to design a website around their needs rather than imposing our own idea of a solution upon them. This collaborative blend of observation and interview ensured that we were on the right track and that they would be pleased by and invested in the final product.</p>

          <p>During the entire process, I recorded details about the number of classes, how many students were in each class, the cost of each class, and more in a notebook so that I could refer to it later during the iterative design process.</p>

          <p>This preliminary research resulted in the following site map, which was geared towards providing the community with a tool to make announcements to the community and to provide information for Russian families new to the area who would be interested in joining.</p>
