        <h1>San Antonio Education Partnership | cafécollege Website Redesign</h1>
          <figure><img src="img/cafecollege-hero.png" alt="Comparison of the old cafécollege website and the new" class="displayed-noshadow"></figure>
          <p>My very first experience with user research and design was a self-directed project that I began while I was a College Advisor for the San Antonio Education Partnership. In July 2016, I took the initiative to research ways that our website could be improved and, most importantly, mobile-friendly. The fact that many of our clients' primary or only internet access was through their mobile phones made responsive design a priority. The website as it was did not feature the most important information about our organization on the home page above the fold and was generally difficult to navigate.</p>
          <p>Here is the home page as it was on desktop:</p>
          <figure><img src="img/cafecollege-old.png" class="displayed-smallest" alt="Image of the old cafécollege website on desktop"></figure>
          <p>Here you can see that it was just a scaled-down version on mobile and not responsive:</p>
          <figure><img src="img/cafecollege-old-mobile.jpg" class="displayed-smallest" alt="Image of the old cafécollege website on mobile"></figure>
          <p>After self-directed study on user experience research, I conducted usability tests with clients and communicated with our organization's program manager, executive director, and the third-party web developer concerning our users' needs for the website. I presented to them the following findings:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <h1>SAEP Desktop Website Usability Test</h1>
            <p>The usability tests were recorded using Quicktime on a 2016 Macbook with a Samson GoMic. You can see from the videos that the hero image is a bit cutoff on the small screen. This didn’t affect usability. The YouTube videos of the tests are private and viewers must be given explicit permission to view the videos. Participants signed a consent form before being recorded stating, "<em>I understand that my usability test session will be recorded. I grant the San Antonio Education Partnership and cafécollege permission to use this recording for internal use only, for the purpose of improving the designs being tested</em>."</p>
            <p>The following is the script that is read at the beginning:</p>
            <p><em>"Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything. You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether it works as intended. The session will take less than an hour. The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.
            <p>Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions.<p>
            <p>If you have any questions as we go along, just ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away, since we’re interested in how people do when they don’t have someone sitting next to them to help. But if you still have any questions when we’re done I’ll try to answer them then. And if you need to take a break at any point, just let me know.</p>
            <p>You may have noticed the microphone. With your permission, we’re going to record what happens on the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to help us figure out how to improve the site, and it won’t be seen by anyone except the people working on this project. And it helps me, because I don’t have to take as many notes. If you don’t mind, I’m going to ask you to sign a simple permission form for us. It just says that we have your permission to record you, and that the recording will only be seen by the people working on the project. Do you have any questions so far?"</em></p>
            <p>The following are the tasks which the participants completed (in no particular order):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Find out who is eligible for the cafécollege Scholarship.</li>
              <li>Find out who who founded the partnership and when.</li>
              <li>In which high schools are services provided?</li>
              <li>Find the link to the cafécollege companion site.</li>
              <li>Find out where the SAEP is located and when it’s open.</li>
              <li>Find the staff directory.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Participants</h2>
            <h3>Participant A</h3>
            <p>Top usability issue: For the “find the contact information of a particular advisor” task, she initially clicked “Contact Us.” After that didn’t yield the results she wanted, she went to the “About Us” tab and found the “Staff” button, where she would have found staff contact information.</p>
	           <p>Participant A is very proficient at using the internet and computers in general. She very quickly found all the information she needed and had little to no issues navigating the site. This was expected as she was a preliminary participant that I also used to evaluate the test itself and to improve it.</p>
             <p>Internal notes: Based on that evaluation, I will make sure each participant has access to a mouse as well as the computer touchpad so that they may use whichever they’re more comfortable with. I should also make a point to mention to every participant that they should try to think out loud as much as possible.</p>
             <h3>Participant B</h3>
             <p>Top usability issue: When he was completing the “who founded the partnership and when” task, he didn’t realize that the “About Us” link was actually a link, and was only searching through the mouse-over menu that drops down from it. It might be helpful to put an additional “About Us” (or differently worded) link inside of the menu, or to make it more obvious that “About Us” is clickable (maybe with a border outline on mouseover so it looks more like a button).</p>
             <p>Participant B was proficient at using computers and had no problem navigating around the site quickly. He seemed to enjoy exploring the page and giving feedback on aesthetic aspects of the site (which we are not particularly concerned with here). He (and the next participant) glossed right over the contact information (location and hours of operation) which is at the bottom of every page. It could be helpful to make this information more prominent somehow.</p>
             <p>He mentioned that he believed a search bar would be helpful, though I’m not sure that would be very reasonable for a website of this size.</p>
             <p>Participant B was already aware that “Road to Success” is the name of the program through which SAEP provides services to local high schools. It might be useful to have a description rather than the title of the program in the menu (maybe even something as simple as “High Schools Served,” which would link to the R2S program section of the website).</p>
             <p>Internal notes: I made sure that he had access to a mouse; however, the Bluetooth connection kept cutting in and out, making the mouse unusable for a few seconds at a time, which was very distracting. For the next usability test, I made sure to use a wired mouse so I didn’t have to worry about the connection.</p>
             <h3>Participant C</h3>
             <p>Top usability issue: Participant C had two usability issues which I would say are equal. The first was the same as Participant B’s: she didn’t realize that the “About Us” link in the menu was clickable. She thought it was just a title that revealed a sub-menu on mouseover. Her second issue was that she had difficulty finding the local high schools served because she didn’t realize that “Road to Success” was that particular program. Changing the link to something like “High Schools,” “High Schools Served,” or “Partner High Schools” might help create that link. Even though this is clear in the description of R2S on the very front page, most people won’t carefully read the whole page before clicking and searching. Having said that, she did guess pretty quickly that “Road to Success” would lead her to the information that she was looking for.</p>
             <p>Participant C also had no difficulty navigating the site outside of her two usability issues. Like Participant B, she did not initially realize that the location and hours of operation for the website are at the bottom of every page.</p>
             <h2>Summary</h2>
             <p>Overall the website was very well-received and more than one participant complimented the aesthetics of the site. Generally, the tasks were completed very easily and quickly. These are the top 3 usability issues, in order of difficulty:</p>
             <ol>
               <li>Making it clear that the “About Us” link is clickable, or adding another item to the drop-down mouseover menu that would lead to the same page.</li>
               <li>Creating a link between “Road to Success” and the fact that it is a high school program.</li>
               <li>Making the information in the footer more prominent, or just making sure that that information is available under “Contact Us,” which I’m sure it will be.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>Outside of that, I have two other suggestions for the website, which may or may not be already planned:</p>
             <ol>
               <li>Giving contact information for each advisor (both R2S and cafécollege) on the Staff page and also possibly on the “Contact Us” page.</li>
               <li>Making the text hotline very prominent on the website. We also need to make sure that the text hotline is promoted in general and also kept up with (if there is no response, people probably won’t bother texting again).</li>
             </ol>
           </blockquote>
           <p>These usability tests were a great learning experience for me and confirmed to me that a career pivot to UX research and design would be a rewarding decision. As a result of the tests and an analysis of what exactly our goals were concerning our website, I convinced the program manager and executive director that we could do a redesign of our website on our own and maintain it through Wordpress rather than relying on a third-party developer, saving the San Antonio Education Partnership approximately $13,000 by designing and maintaining the website internally.</p>
           <p>The transition of the website from the old to the new design is still ongoing, but our current design is the following on the desktop home page:</p>
           <figure><img src="img/cafecollege-new.png" class="displayed-smallest" alt="Image of the new cafécollege website on desktop"></figure>
           <p>And this is the current iteration of the home page on mobile:</p>
